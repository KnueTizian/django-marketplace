## Getting Started
1. Create and activate a virtual environment called `devenv` where we'll install everything this project needs.

source devenv/bin/activate
```

2. Make sure pip is up to date, install the development requirements.
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
